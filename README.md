## 🚀 Project Overview

The **fanZ Sports App** aims to bring sports enthusiasts closer to the action with features that allow users to:
- 🔍 **Filter players** by team or position.
- 📝 **Display teams of 15 players** with ease.
- 🕹️ **Interact with smooth UI components** for selecting and organizing players.

This app is built using a **robust technology stack** to ensure high performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Here's the tech stack that powers this app:

- **Kotlin** 💻: The backbone of Android development with modern, concise code.
- **Firebase Realtime Database** 🔥: Real-time data retrieval and syncing for seamless player updates.
- **Data Structures** 📊: Optimized data handling for quick filtering and organization.
- **MVVM Architecture** 🏗️: Separation of concerns with ViewModel, Repository, and LiveData for smooth UI updates and easy testability.
- **Jetpack Components** 🚀: Efficient UI elements and lifecycle-aware components for a flawless experience.
- **Coroutines & Flows** ⏳: Manage asynchronous tasks and data streams effortlessly.

## 📋 Features

- **Real-Time Player Data** 📡: Fetch player stats and details directly from Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Filter Options** 🗂️: Filter players by team and position, with visual indicators for selected filters.
- **Dynamic UI** 🎨: Background colors and overlays change based on selection, providing intuitive visual feedback.
- **Scrollable Search and Filters** 🔄: The search bar and filters hide on scroll-down and reappear on scroll-up for a cleaner view.
- **User-Friendly RecyclerView** 🖼️: Select a player, see dynamic states (active, non-active), and add them to a new team lineup.

## 📐 Architecture

The project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation between UI and business logic:

1. **Model** 🧩: Holds the data and logic for filtering, retrieving, and managing player information.
2. **View** 👁️: The UI components, managed through Jetpack Compose or XML layouts.
3. **ViewModel** 🧠: Handles data retrieval, processing, and exposes data for the view, using LiveData and Coroutines.

## 📈 Optimizations

To tackle performance, we utilized:
- **Efficient Data Structures** for faster filtering.
- **Firebase Offline Mode** to handle limited connectivity.
- **Coroutines** for background data processing, reducing main thread workload.
